# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      number of authors to publish their works."

      print each book to order. Not only is this method of printing mindful of
      our planet because no books go to waste, but it is mindful of our authors
      too. As an author, you are never required to shoulder the cost and hassle
      of printing, storing and transporting large quantities of your book.
      When a book is ordered by a reader, a retailer or the author, it is
      printed and dispatched in a matter of days."
